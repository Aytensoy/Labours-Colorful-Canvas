        <p>Welcome to İznik, a town not just famous for its stunning tiles, but a place that stands as a monumental
            crossroads of history. The scenes you are about to color witnessed events that shaped the very
            foundations of Christianity for billions around the world. Before it was İznik, it was the great Roman
            city of <strong>Nicaea</strong>.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">The First Council of Nicaea (325 AD)</h2>
        <p>In the year 325 AD, Emperor Constantine the Great, facing deep disagreements within the rapidly spreading
            Christian faith, summoned bishops from across the known world to this very city. This historic
            gathering, the first-ever ecumenical (worldwide) council, was tasked with unifying the church by
            defining its essential beliefs.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">The Lasting Legacy: The Nicene Creed</h2>
        <p>The most significant outcome of this council was the creation of the <strong>Nicene Creed</strong>. This
            powerful statement of faith articulated the core beliefs held by the vast majority of Christians,
            providing a unifying text that could be recited by believers everywhere. Today, nearly 1,700 years
            later, the Nicene Creed remains a central and revered prayer in Catholic, Orthodox, and many Protestant
            churches worldwide. It is a living link to the historical events that took place right here.</p>
