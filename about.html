        <h1>A Grandmother's Dream, Built with Love</h1>

        <p>Hello, and welcome to my little corner of magic. My name is Ayten, and I'm a 61-year-old grandmother from
            Istanbul with a lifelong passion for learning.</p>

        <p>This game began with a simple inspiration: my 2-year-old granddaughter. I wanted to create a digital
            playground for her—a world that was 100% safe, creative, and joyful, especially during the quiet hours after
            a long day of play and housework.</p>

        <p>I didn't have a team of developers, but I had a powerful idea and the determination to learn. Over the course
            of a year, working late into the night, I teamed up with the most modern creative partner I could find:
            Artificial Intelligence. AI became my tireless coding assistant, helping me translate my vision—a
            grandmother's love—into functional, beautiful code.</p>

        <p>But let me be clear: every idea, every color choice, every magical feature, and the entire soul of this game
            came from my heart. The AI was the tool, but the love was the architect.</p>

        <p>What started as a personal project has become a dream I'm thrilled to share with families everywhere. Thank
            you for being here. Every purchase supports a grandmother who dared to dream and shows that with a little
            love and the right tools, anything is possible.</p>
