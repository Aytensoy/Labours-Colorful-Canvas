Magical Coloring Game - Features and Founder's Story

--- THE FOUNDER'S STORY ---

My name is Ayten, and I am a 61-year-old grandmother from Istanbul with a lifelong passion for learning.

This game began with a simple inspiration: my 2-year-old granddaughter. I wanted to create a digital playground for her—a world that was 100% safe, creative, and joyful, especially during the quiet hours after a long day of play and housework.

I didn't have a team of developers, but I had a powerful idea and the determination to learn. Over the course of a year, working late into the night, I teamed up with the most modern creative partner I could find: Artificial Intelligence. AI became my tireless coding assistant, helping me translate my vision—a grandmother's love—into functional, beautiful code.

But let me be clear: every idea, every color choice, every magical feature, and the entire soul of this game came from my heart. The AI was the tool, but the love was the architect.

What started as a personal project has become a dream I'm thrilled to share with families everywhere. Thank you for being here. Every purchase supports a grandmother who dared to dream and shows that with a little love and the right tools, anything is possible.
